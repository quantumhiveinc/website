# Frontend Marketing Pages Development Plan

This plan outlines the steps for developing the frontend marketing pages for the QuantumHive-Website project using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v3, and ShadCN UI components.

## 1. Identify Core Marketing Pages:
*   **Homepage:** Introduction to QuantumHive, key offerings, call to actions.
*   **About Us:** Company mission, values, team, history.
*   **Services/Products:** Detailed descriptions of QuantumHive's offerings.
*   **Contact Us:** Contact form, location information, contact details.
*   **Blog/News (Optional):** Company updates, industry insights.
*   **Case Studies/Portfolio (Optional):** Showcase successful projects.

## 2. Define Page Structure and Content:
*   For each core page, outline the main sections and the type of content they will contain (text, images, videos, forms, etc.).
*   Consider the user flow and how pages will link together.

## 3. Technology Implementation:
*   Utilize Next.js for server-side rendering or static site generation for performance and SEO.
*   Implement components using TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability.
*   Style the pages using Tailwind CSS v3 for rapid UI development and consistency.
*   Integrate ShadCN UI components for pre-built, accessible UI elements where appropriate (e.g., forms, buttons, navigation).
*   Plan for integration with the backend API for any dynamic content or form submissions.

## 4. Development Workflow:
*   Start with the core pages (Homepage, About Us, Services, Contact Us).
*   Develop pages as React components within the Next.js `frontend` directory.
*   Implement styling using Tailwind CSS classes.
*   Integrate ShadCN UI components as needed.
*   Develop necessary API integrations for forms or dynamic content.
*   Implement responsive design for various screen sizes.
*   Add optional pages (Blog, Case Studies) as required.

## 5. Testing:
*   Perform visual testing across different browsers and devices.
*   Test functionality, including forms and API integrations.
*   Ensure accessibility standards are met.
