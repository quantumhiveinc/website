    <p>The traditional security model of a hardened perimeter with trusted internal networks ("trust but verify") is no longer sufficient in today's distributed and threat-laden environments. Enter Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), a modern security strategy built on the principle of "never trust, always verify."</p>
    <h2>Core Principles of Zero Trust</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Verify Explicitly:</strong> Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Least Privilege Access:</strong> Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to secure both data and productivity.</li>
      <li><strong>Assume Breach:</strong> Minimize blast radius for breaches and prevent lateral movement by segmenting access by network, user, devices, and application awareness. Verify all sessions are encrypted end-to-end.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why Adopt Zero Trust?</h2>
    <p>Zero Trust provides enhanced security against modern threats like ransomware and insider threats. It supports secure remote work and cloud adoption by removing implicit trust based on network location. It also helps organizations meet stricter compliance requirements.</p>
    <h2>Implementing Zero Trust</h2>
    <p>Implementation is a journey, not a destination. It typically involves strengthening identity management (MFA, SSO), implementing micro-segmentation, enforcing device health checks, and continuously monitoring and analyzing security telemetry.</p>
    <p>Adopting a Zero Trust mindset is crucial for building a resilient security posture in the modern digital landscape.</p>
